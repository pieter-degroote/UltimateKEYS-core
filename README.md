# UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout - Core for Windows/Linux

**International US QWERTY layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys (Compose Key).**  
This layout is based on US QWERTY, and has borrowed some aspects from EurKEY and US-International.

This release (and repository) only contains the main keyboard layout of UltimateKEYS.

The additional customized Compose Key sequences (Multi_key) have not been included in this release/repository, since these may change more frequently over time.

As such, I only consider the main layout of UltimateKEYS as the 'core element'.
